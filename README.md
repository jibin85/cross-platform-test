# 🖥️ Cross-Platform Application - Quarkus & Camel

## 🌟 Preface
This project utilizes the **Quarkus Java framework** along with **Apache Camel** for a **Cross-Platform Application** test. It features a **Quarkus-Camel-based web application** developed using **Java 17**, designed to accept two numbers from the user, add them, and display the result on a web page.

Since it's a **web service**, it can be accessed on multiple platforms (**Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, etc.**). Additionally, a **standalone Android app** has been created with a web viewer to ensure accessibility across devices, making it a **stateless application (without a database)**.
